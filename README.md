# Grocery-Inventory

For this proejct, I had to create an Inventory system that would be used for a grocery store. My professor gave us the variables that we would need to keep track of for each item. We needed to create classes for each type of food (i.e protein, vegetables, processed food, etc). We also had to incorpate a JSON file which contained county codes for different types of cheese. All input was validated using regular expressions and stored into an Array of 5 items.
